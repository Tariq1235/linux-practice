Today on June 13th 2025  I started learning Linux.
I practiced file commands and directory navigation.
Tomorrow I'll learn automation and bash scripting.

### Lesson - #1 - Navigating the Filesystem


## June 13th 2025 - Lesson #1


### What I Learned
- [I learned the basics of Linux.`mkdir`, `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `nano`, etc]
- [Im finally Learning code and able to get a better understanding]

### Commands I practiced
```bash
cd /etc
ls -lah
pwd
cd ~/linux-practice
tree -L 2

## Lesson #2: Managing Files and Directories

### What I learned
- Created and renamed files and folders using `touch`, `mv`, and `mkdir`
- Moved files between directories
- Started understanding the power of file structure in projects

### Commands I Practiced
```bash
touch file.txt
mv file.txt renamed.txt
mv file.txt renamed.txt
mkdir projects
cp renamed.txt projects/
rm renamed.txt

Note - I learned that mv is also used to rename and not just Move!

## Lesson #3 - Viewing, Editing, and Searching Files
 
### What I learned
- Used `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`, and `nano`
- Searched for terms inside files using `grep`
- Edited `journal.txt` using `nano`

### Commands I Practiced
```bash
nano journal.txt
cat journal.txt
`grep "automation"` journal.txt

### Lesson#4 - Permissions and Ownership

### What I learned
- Read and understand `-rw-r--r--` style permissions
- Used `chmod` to control who can access files
- Learned about `chown` and groups like `vboxsf`

### Commands I practiced
```bash
chmod 700 private-notes
chmod 744 shared-scripts.sh
ls -l

Note - Im going to do further practice with Permissions until it becomes 
second nature - especially since this will be key for automation and 
security.

***Reflection***: Im learning alot about the field CyberSecurity. I want to use all of the resources online to my advantage to be able to get a jumpstart on a career in this field.
My end goal is to find a job in BlockChain Technology using all of the information that Im gathering overtime.
I will have to start somewhere in this field, which is why I am going to school to obtain a B.S in CyberSecurity. Im thinking about getting a double major in Computers science.
I want to have all of everything I need to stand out from anywhere else standing in my way of success. I dont honestly believe in school but I want to have a boost in my resume  once I start submitting it to different Organizations.
I will start out in the Cybersecurity field and obtain the structure and daily lifestyle of what It will be like working with code and other people in the same field. I will of course be able to to learn thing thats not taught online from peers.
I will want to use all of the great things I learn on this journey to become the best in the BlockChain field. I will continue to upload in this Journel to keep track of all of the accomplishments I have completed.
